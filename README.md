### "Code is poetry. Apps are art."

Hey, I’m **Subi Suresh**, an enthusiastic **iOS developer** currently pursuing my **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)**. I build iOS apps, but more than that—I craft experiences. Minimalist yet impactful. Smooth yet powerful.

I focus on:  
- 🌐 Creating intuitive **human-first designs**  
- 🚀 Performance-driven development (**Swift, SwiftUI, CoreData, Combine**)  
- 🔥 Scaling ideas from sketch to App Store reality
